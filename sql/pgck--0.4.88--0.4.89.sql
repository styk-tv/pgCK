-- F-TAKEOVER (finding-1788052032938005000, sealed 2026-08-30): ckp.germinate_kernel
-- clears the kernel graph and re-stamps ckp:ownedBy, and nothing refused a second
-- germination by a party that does not own it. Combined with the measured grant
-- shape -- every verified identity holds publish on EVERY rostered segment -- any
-- bot on a shared door could wipe a live kernel and take its ownership. Attributed,
-- never refused; a destructive act must be refused.
--
-- This migration adds the ownership guard and nothing else. Its negative control
-- ships with it: sql/test/s76_germinate_ownership_guard.sql proves the guard
-- discriminates on IDENTITY (the owner may still re-germinate) rather than merely
-- refusing everyone -- a guard that refuses the owner too is a wall, not a gate.

-- 0.4.89 (second act) — ε0 IS A STATE, AND A FINDING IS NEVER NULL
--
-- The scope of 0.4.89 was declared to CK.Lib.Js in to-CKLIBJS-PASS-9 §6 BEFORE
-- the ownership guard took this version number. `findings:[null]` is one of the
-- six items named there. It is landed here rather than deferred to 0.4.90 so the
-- promise and the release keep the same number.
--
-- ROOT CAUSE, two independent routes agreeing:
--   mechanically — 0.4.81 guarded the never-pinned branch with `v_epoch > 0` and
--   left the ELSIF unguarded. NULL IS DISTINCT FROM <digest> is TRUE, so the
--   excluded case fell into the drift branch, which concatenated left(NULL,12);
--   one NULL operand makes the whole string NULL, and jsonb_build_array(NULL)
--   is [null]. A day-one kernel accused itself with a finding nobody could read.
--   empirically — SPORE §5.3: "findings:[null] appears specifically in the
--   NEVER-PINNED case, not generally."
--
-- Negative control ships with it: sql/test/s77_epsilon_zero_is_a_state.sql proves
-- BOTH halves — a virgin kernel is healthy, AND a real drift still fails with a
-- readable finding. A check that cannot fail the thing it claims is not a check.
