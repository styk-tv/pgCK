-- pgck 0.4.89 -> 0.4.90
--
-- THE OUTSTANDING LIST, CLOSED. 0.4.89's scope was declared to CK.Lib.Js in
-- to-CKLIBJS-PASS-9 §6 as six items; the ownership guard took that version number
-- in between and only ONE of the six shipped. This release carries the rest, plus
-- two defects measured through the door on 2026-09-01.
--
--   §3 id-form   instance.get passed the RAW id to _envelope, which looks up the
--                BARE form only. Every other form the substrate itself emits
--                (`ckp://Type#id` — 82 of 98 rows on the measured bench —
--                `urn:ckp:…`) missed, and the reply was `ok:true, instance:null`:
--                a CONFIDENT ABSENCE about an id we minted. Two clients built the
--                same private lens to work around it. Both halves of the ruling
--                ship: resolve every emitted form, and REFUSE rather than null.
--
--   §2 epoch     Reads rendered the absent kernel_epoch row as 0 (six sites),
--                apply's fromEpoch rendered the SAME absent row as 1, and
--                bump_epoch seeded at 1 then incremented — so a virgin kernel's
--                first apply moved 1->2 and epoch 1 was a PHANTOM no read ever
--                reported and no ckp:Epoch ever sealed. One convention now: the
--                row is seeded at germination, both planes read 0, first apply is
--                an honest 0->1. Already-advanced kernels are untouched.
--
--   Q-1 / A6     surface.check gains `roster` — and it reports BOTH halves, because
--                the 2026-08-29 ruling changed what the honest answer is: the grant
--                set is the GUC unioned with every sealed ckp:Kernel. The ledger
--                half lives in ckp._ledger_kernels(), called by BOTH the bgworker
--                tick and ckp.roster(), because a probe that re-implements the gate
--                tests the probe. This also closes A6: the roster union shipped in
--                0.4.89 with no verb and no gate, which was our own §2 violation.
--
--                The original Q-1 ruling specified a rosterNote naming the RESTART
--                rule. That doctrine is RETIRED, and shipping it in a string is
--                exactly the R-15 failure that hit every other seat in the fleet the
--                same day. The note cites ruling-1788038690953958000 instead of
--                restating it, so it cannot become the next echo.
--
--   Q-2          surface.refusals gains registryDigest (sha256 over the ordered code
--                set) so a client caches on the digest, not on count.
--
--   Q-3          The registry gains `plane` — declared | procedural | NULL. Assigned
--                by a rule, never by hand, and NULL where the classification would
--                be a guess: sqlstates 22023 and 42704 each carry codes of both
--                planes. A confident label there would be the findings:[null] defect
--                wearing a different hat.
--
--   L-6          Apply's SUCCESS path returned `approvals` without `quorum`, while
--                the REFUSAL path returned both. An approval count without the bar
--                it cleared is not a number. The pair now ships on success, with
--                `rehearsal` stating out loud that quorum 1 is not consensus.
--
--   dup adoption Nothing refuses or dedupes a SECOND Adoption of a module already
--                adopted; pgck had two of urn:ckp:module:wave, and ck_reach listed
--                the module twice because _adopted_graphs returned it twice. Cured
--                by idempotence rather than refusal — re-adopting is a legitimate
--                retry, and refusing it would break re-adoption after supersession.
--
-- Negative control: sql/test/s78_outstanding_list.sql — every claim above with the
-- case that would fail if the fix were absent.

-- Q-3: existing installs already have the table, so the column must be ALTERed in
-- and the classification rule re-run on the upgrade path.
