-- C-16 — CLASS 2B, verified reachable before registering it.
-- pgRDF's LIB spec asks consumers to add 2B (dependent objects) to the refusal
-- classifier, and warns more usefully still: treat as a REFUSAL anything that is
-- not class XX, because XX is the only code a genuine fault carries. Registering
-- a code we cannot raise would be the declared-but-unreal pattern this substrate
-- keeps finding in other places, so the condition was triggered first:
--     pgrdf.drop_graph(g, cascade => false) on a graph with inferred rows
--     -> 2BP01 "drop_graph: inferred rows present (graph_id = 1);
--               pass cascade => true to proceed"
-- The engine's message already names its cure, so `teaches` points at that prose
-- rather than paraphrasing it. A restatement is how the retired roster doctrine
-- spread through six documents, and refusal copy is exactly where R-15 says a
-- doctrine sweep must reach. Classified `procedural`: a dependency STATE refused
-- it, not the law.
--
-- E-1 — AN EPOCH WITHOUT ITS SURFACE CANNOT BE CHECKED AGAINST ANYTHING.
-- Raised by pgRDF. ckp.kernel_epoch was (kernel, epoch) while ckp:EpochShape
-- demands epoch AND surfaceDigest together — minCount 1 each, pattern
-- ^[0-9a-f]{64}$. The table was weaker than the class it seals against, and a
-- pin recording the position without the law it ran under is not a pin.
--
-- (pgRDF attributed this to PassShape. wave:PassShape requires ofWave and
-- director; the shape that demands both is EpochShape. Verified on the loaded
-- law, and the correction strengthens their point rather than weakening it. The
-- probe carries it as a CONTROL: if EpochShape does not demand surfaceDigest,
-- the obligation reports BROKEN, because then the premise is wrong.)
--
-- The digest is written from the SAME v_surfd already sealed into the Epoch and
-- the Materialization — one computation, three writers, so the table cannot
-- drift from the seal. That is the D-1 failure prevented by construction rather
-- than detected afterwards.
--
-- The backfill takes ONLY what was actually sealed. A kernel whose current epoch
-- has no sealed ckp:Epoch keeps NULL rather than a digest computed now, which
-- would assert which surface was in force at a moment nobody measured. Measured
-- on the rig: 10 of 14 rows backfilled, 4 left NULL. Absence is an answer.
